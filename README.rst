Running
-------

NGES is meant to run on Ren'Py 8.1, on Windows x86_64 and Linux x86_64.
Mac might also work, I haven't tested it.

This includes prebuilt binaries, so you can download this repoisitory, and
copy renpy-project into your Ren'Py projects directory. Rename it in your
projects directory to whatever you want, select it in the launcher, and
launch the game.

Building
--------

Download the repo, set the environment variable RENPY_BUILD to the path
to renpy-build, and then run ./build.sh. Building has only ever been
done on Linux.

License
-------

MIT for the new stuff, everything else is under it's own license.

Support Policy
--------------

If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.
